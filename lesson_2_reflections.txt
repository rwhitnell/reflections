**What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?**

A .git folder is created with the structure to store the commits.
Doing it sets everything up for starting to commit files to the repository.

**How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?**

The staging area is an intermediate stage between the working directory and the repository
It allows related files to be grouped together and then entered into the repository in a single commit.
Other files can be excluded if they aren't related to the files being staged.
