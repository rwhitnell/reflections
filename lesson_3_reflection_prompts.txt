**When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?**

If I'm working from multiple computers, a remote repository can allow me to keep the projects in sync on all those computers.
In working with someone else, a remote repository allows all authors to work on the project while minimizing conflicts.

**Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?**

If someone else is making changes to the repository, you may not be ready for those yet.
